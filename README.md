# Logging-Toolkit

This repository is dedicated to managing and standardizing logging configuration functions across various programming languages, including but not limited to Python, Java, and others.

## Project Structure

The toolkit is organized as follows:

### src/python/

- `setup_logging.py`: A Python script that provides functions to setup and configure logging.
- `general_logging.json`: A JSON file containing general logging configurations for testing and as a reference.
- `error_logging.json`: A JSON file containing error logging configurations for testing and as a reference.

## Future Plans

- `setup_logging.java`: (Planned) Implement a logging setup function for Java, similar to the Python implementation.

## Installation Requirements

To run the scripts, you'll need the following libraries installed:

### Python:

```text
- logging
- json
- os
```

### Java:

TBD: Required libraries and setup instructions for Java will be provided once the implementation is completed.
